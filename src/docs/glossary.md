## Greenwich calendar date
The Greenwich calendar date is a date representing in the standard usage format of the Gregorian calendar, e.g., 4/1/2019 for the 1st day of April in the year 2019.  The day part of a Greenwich calendar day is often represented as a whole number, but in order to truly represent a point in time, the day should be fractional, e.g., 1.25 to represent 6 AM.

## Julian Date
A Julian Date is a value representing the number of days, and fraction of a day, that has elapsed since a given fundamental epoch.  The fundamental epoch used by astronomers is Greenwich mean noon January 1, 4713 BC.  Remember that each new Julian Day begins 12h 00m UT, half a day out of step with the civil day in time zone 0.
